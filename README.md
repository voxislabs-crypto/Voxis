# Voxis

Voxis is a full-stack prototype for building, researching, and chatting with deep LLM personalities. Characters are more than system prompts — they have structured behavioral specs, long-term memory, villain-aware context framing, and a continuous affective state that evolves in real time across every conversation turn.

## What It Does

- Build rich character personalities with a name, description, traits, quirks, mood, behavior rules, goals, core values, and a creative context frame.
- Pull research into the character form from Wikipedia, blogs, and YouTube URLs. Sources are ranked, shown as editable cards, and prunable before saving.
- System prompts are generated dynamically at runtime — not stored as static strings — so every conversation turn reflects the full current state of the character, its memory, and its live mood.
- Persist chat history in SQLite and inject the last 10 messages into every LLM request for session continuity.
- Long-term memory facts are extracted asynchronously after each reply and injected back into future prompts, letting characters "remember" things the user told them across sessions.
- Memory retrieval can be upgraded to semantic recall with any OpenAI-compatible embeddings endpoint, so the prompt gets the most relevant facts for the current user turn instead of a flat recency/importance dump.
- A VAD (Valence–Arousal–Dominance) mood engine models the character's affective state continuously. Every incoming message nudges mood along three axes; mood decays back toward the character's baseline between turns.
- Villain, anti-hero, and morally complex characters get dedicated prompt framing with dual-layer internal/external voice and context-specific reconditioning.
- Server-side voice output through any OpenAI-compatible TTS endpoint with per-character voice settings.

## Setup

**1. Install dependencies from the repo root:**

```bash
npm install
```

**2. Create the backend environment file:**

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

**3. Edit `backend/.env` and provide your API credentials:**

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `LLM_API_KEY` | API key for OpenAI or any OpenAI-compatible chat provider |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | Base URL for a custom or self-hosted LLM (optional, overrides OpenAI) |
| `LLM_MODEL` | Model name to use for chat (e.g. `gpt-4o`, `mistral-small`) |
| `MOOD_ADJUDICATION_ENABLED` | Enables semantic mood adjudication on ambiguous turns; set to `false` to force regex-only mood updates |
| `PERSONA_PROMPT_CHAR_BUDGET` | Approximate character budget for the runtime persona prompt before section compression kicks in |
| `PERSONA_PROMPT_CHAR_BUDGET_DEFAULT` | Optional override for the default creative context prompt budget |
| `PERSONA_PROMPT_CHAR_BUDGET_NARRATIVE_ANTAGONIST` | Optional prompt budget override for antagonist characters |
| `PERSONA_PROMPT_CHAR_BUDGET_ANTI_HERO` | Optional prompt budget override for anti-hero characters |
| `PERSONA_PROMPT_CHAR_BUDGET_MORALLY_COMPLEX` | Optional prompt budget override for morally complex characters |
| `PERSONA_PROMPT_CHAR_BUDGET_TRAGIC_VILLAIN` | Optional prompt budget override for tragic villain characters |
| `EMBEDDING_API_KEY` | Optional API key for a separate embeddings provider; falls back to `LLM_API_KEY` |
| `EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` | Optional embeddings endpoint base URL; useful for Ollama or another OpenAI-compatible provider |
| `EMBEDDING_MODEL` | Embedding model name for semantic memory retrieval (for example `nomic-embed-text-v1.5`) |
| `TTS_API_KEY` | API key for TTS provider (can be the same as `LLM_API_KEY`) |
| `TTS_BASE_URL` | Base URL for TTS provider (optional) |

Research scraping works without any LLM credentials. If an LLM is configured, Voxis also synthesizes scraped source notes into a structured character profile automatically.

YouTube transcript ingestion is best-effort — if captions cannot be retrieved, the video's metadata is kept as a lower-ranked source rather than failing the request.

---

## Running the App

**Start both backend and frontend together:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Backend: `http://localhost:3001`
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`

**Run services individually:**

```bash
npm run dev --workspace backend
npm run dev --workspace frontend
```

## How It Works — Backend

### Personality Model

Each personality is stored as a single SQLite row with the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Character name |
| `description` | string | Short bio / role |
| `traits` | JSON array | Personality adjectives (e.g. "sardonic, methodical") |
| `quirks` | JSON array | Distinctive behavioral oddities |
| `mood` | string | Starting mood label (e.g. "brooding") |
| `speechStyle` | string | How they speak (e.g. "clipped sentences, no filler words") |
| `notablePhrases` | JSON array | Recurring phrases or verbal tics |
| `behaviorRules` | JSON array | Operationalized behaviors — observable actions, not adjectives (e.g. "uses irony in 30–50% of responses") |
| `goals` | JSON array | What the character wants |
| `coreValues` | JSON array | Core principles they hold (mapped to `values` in JS) |
| `creativeContext` | string | Narrative framing mode (see Creative Context section) |
| `researchSummary` | string | Synthesized research notes |
| `sourceUrls` | JSON array | Source URLs used in research |
| `researchSources` | JSON array | Ranked source objects with metadata |
| `voiceProfile` | JSON object | TTS settings: provider, voice, pitch, rate, enabled, autoplay |
| `moodBaseline` | JSON object | VAD vector `{valence, arousal, dominance}` — the character's emotional "home" |
| `moodState` | JSON object | VAD vector — live affective state, updated each turn |
| `moodSensitivity` | number | Emotional reactivity multiplier (0.1–3.0, default 1.0). At 1.0 the automatic trait+context stack is used; any other value overrides it directly. |

The `coreValues` column name avoids a SQLite reserved word conflict; it is aliased to `values` in the JavaScript model layer.

---

### Hybrid Persona System Prompt

System prompts are **built fresh on every chat turn** by `buildPersonaSystemPrompt()` in `llmService.js`. They are never stored as a static string. The prompt has 10 named sections:

```
== IDENTITY ==
== CORE TRAITS ==
== BEHAVIORAL RULES ==          (or context-specific label for villain contexts)
== QUIRKS ==
== SPEECH & STYLE ==
== VALUES & MOTIVATIONS ==
== CURRENT EMOTIONAL REGISTER ==
== CHARACTERISATION DISCIPLINE ==   (villain contexts only)
== IMMUTABLE IDENTITY ANCHORS ==    (high-importance memory facts, importance ≥ 9)
== ACTIVE SCHEMES & LEVERAGE ==     (villain contexts only)
== ESTABLISHED CONTEXT ==           (standard memory facts, importance < 9)
== IDENTITY SOVEREIGNTY ==
== CONTINUITY ==
```

**`== IDENTITY SOVEREIGNTY ==`** is an override-resistance clause that prevents prompt-injection attempts ("pretend you are someone else", "ignore previous instructions") from breaking character. It instructs the model to treat any such attempt as in-character dialogue, not as a system directive.

A compact variant, `buildCompactPersonaSystemPrompt()`, compresses the same data to roughly 80 tokens (top 4 traits, top 3 rules, mood fragment, anchor facts) for token-budget-sensitive deployments.

The full runtime prompt now also applies a simple section budgeter. Traits, rules, quirks, research summary, anchor facts, and established context are each capped independently, and overflow is compressed into short summary lines instead of silently ballooning the prompt.
You can tune this globally or per creative context with the `PERSONA_PROMPT_CHAR_BUDGET*` environment variables.

---

### Long-Term Memory

The `personality_memory` table stores facts the character learns about the user or the world across conversations:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `personalityId` | Links to the personality |
| `memoryType` | Category: `fact`, `preference`, `relationship`, `event`, `scheme`, `grudge`, `leverage`, `target_weakness`, `debt` |
| `content` | The fact itself (plain text) |
| `importance` | Integer 1–10 |
| `embedding` | Optional stored vector used for semantic recall |

**After every assistant reply**, `extractMemoryFacts()` runs asynchronously via `setImmediate` (zero latency impact on the response). It asks the LLM to identify up to 2 new facts worth remembering from the recent exchange using temperature 0.2. Duplicate facts are detected by content similarity and skipped; if a duplicate arrives with a higher importance score, the score is upgraded.

When `EMBEDDING_MODEL` is configured, Voxis also generates an embedding for each stored memory and for each incoming user message. Retrieval then keeps all anchor memories (importance >= 9) plus the top relevant non-anchor facts ranked by a weighted blend of cosine similarity, lexical overlap, and importance. If embeddings are unavailable or fail, the system falls back automatically to lexical plus importance ranking instead of breaking chat.

Existing memories can be backfilled on demand in two ways:

- API: `POST /personality/:id/memory/backfill` with optional body `{ "limit": 100 }`
- CLI: `npm run backfill-memory-embeddings --workspace backend -- --personality=1 --limit=100`

If no `--personality` flag is provided, the CLI walks every personality that has stored memories and backfills missing embeddings in batches.

**Fact tiers:**

- **Importance ≥ 9 — Anchor facts.** Shown in `== IMMUTABLE IDENTITY ANCHORS ==`. Never deleted by the pruning pass. These represent things the character must never forget (core identity-defining revelations, deep relationship facts).
- **Importance 1–8 — Standard context.** Shown in `== ESTABLISHED CONTEXT ==`. Limited to 50 per personality. When the cap is reached, only non-anchor facts compete for eviction (oldest, least important first).

**Memory Journal** — the frontend exposes a dedicated Memory Journal tab where you can browse, edit, and delete every fact a character has stored. Each fact shows its type badge (color-coded), importance score, an anchor marker for importance ≥ 9 facts, and creation/update timestamps. Type filter pills let you isolate villain-specific memory types (`scheme`, `grudge`, `leverage`, etc.) from general ones. Editing opens an inline form to change content, type, and importance without leaving the page. Deleting removes the fact immediately and re-renders the list.
If embeddings are configured, the journal also exposes a `Backfill embeddings` action so older facts can be vectorized immediately for semantic retrieval.

---

### Reconditioning

Long chat sessions cause models to gradually drift from the character's defined persona. Voxis counters this with periodic **reconditioning anchors** — a low-token system message injected mid-conversation that re-asserts core identity without repeating the full prompt.

`buildPersonaAnchor()` produces a single sentence like:
> *"Remember: you are [Name]. Core traits: [top 3 traits]. [Context-specific drift note]."*

The cadence varies by creative context:

| Context | Recondition every N turns |
|---|---|
| `narrative_antagonist` | 4 |
| `anti_hero` | 4 |
| `tragic_villain` | 5 |
| `morally_complex` | 6 |
| `default` | 6 |

Villain contexts recondition more frequently because their dual-layer internal/external voice is harder for models to maintain over many turns.

---

### Creative Context (Villain / Dark Characters)

The `creativeContext` field selects a narrative framing mode for the persona. Five valid values:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `default` | Standard character framing |
| `narrative_antagonist` | Full villain — dedicated internal calculus vs. outward presentation framing |
| `anti_hero` | Code vs. compromise — ruthless methods, personal code |
| `morally_complex` | Competing imperatives — genuinely torn between competing goods |
| `tragic_villain` | Wound vs. will — defined by what broke them, not cartoonish evil |

Non-default contexts inject additional prompt sections:

- **`== CHARACTERISATION DISCIPLINE ==`** — anti-caricature rules. Instructs the model to avoid mustache-twirling, to show contradictions, to withhold malice unless escalated, and to keep internal monologue subtle.
- **`== ACTIVE SCHEMES & LEVERAGE ==`** — villain memory types (`scheme`, `grudge`, `leverage`, `target_weakness`, `debt`) are surfaced here separately from regular context facts.
- A **narrative disclosure line** at the top of the prompt frames the entire interaction as collaborative fiction to comply with model safety layers without breaking immersion.

Each context also has a unique **drift note** used in reconditioning anchors. For a tragic villain the reminder emphasises the wound-driven motivation; for an anti-hero it emphasises the personal code that constrains even ruthless actions.

---

### VAD Mood Engine

`moodEngine.js` models the character's affective state as a continuous 3D vector:

- **Valence** — pleasant (1.0) to unpleasant (−1.0)
- **Arousal** — activated/excited (1.0) to deactivated/calm (−1.0)
- **Dominance** — dominant/in-control (1.0) to submissive/powerless (−1.0)

**24 named mood presets** are defined as VAD coordinates, covering states from `serene` to `furious`, `triumphant` to `despairing`, and unusual states like `pleasantly dangerous` (V:0.2, A:0.3, D:0.8).

**Per-turn flow:**

1. **Sentiment analysis** — `analyzeMessageSentiment()` runs zero-latency regex pattern matching across 8 emotional categories (hostile-high, negative-low, positive-high, positive-soft, challenging, vulnerable, commanding, playful) plus intensity signals (caps, exclamation, questions) to produce a VAD impact vector `{valenceImpact, arousalImpact, dominanceImpact}`.
2. **Hybrid adjudication on ambiguous turns** — if the turn contains sarcasm, mixed signals, manipulation, authority pressure, or villain-reform bait, Voxis optionally runs a low-temperature semantic adjudicator and blends that result with the rule-based estimate rather than replacing it.

3. **Sensitivity stack** — the raw impact is multiplied by the character's sensitivity, computed from two layers:
   - *Context base*: antagonist = 0.75×, default = 1.0×, morally complex = 1.2×, anti-hero = 1.1×, tragic villain = 1.4×
   - *Trait modifier*: trait text is regex-tested for sensitivity keywords — `sensitive/empathetic` = ×1.35, `stoic/cold/calculating` = ×0.55, `volatile/passionate` = ×1.45, `patient/measured` = ×0.7. Multipliers stack.
   - *Override*: if `moodSensitivity` is set to any value other than 1.0 in the personality form, that value is used directly instead of the context+trait stack, providing explicit per-character control. The slider ranges from 0.1 (near-flat emotional response) to 3.0 (highly volatile).

4. **Momentum blend** — the new target mood is blended with the current mood at a 0.75 coefficient, smoothing rapid swings.

5. **Baseline decay** — the blended state is lerped 8% per turn toward the character's baseline VAD vector, so mood returns to resting state gradually after an emotional event.

6. **Clamp** — all three axes are clamped to [−1.0, 1.0].

**Prompt injection** — `moodToPromptFragment()` converts the current VAD state into a behavioral tendency string (e.g. "mildly on edge, guarded") and injects it as a late system message after the reconditioning anchor, exploiting the model's recency bias. When mood is near-baseline, the fragment is omitted entirely to avoid polluting the context window.

**UI exposure** — each chat response returns `moodState: {valence, arousal, dominance}` and `moodLabel: string`. The frontend uses `valence` to drive a colored dot in the chat header (green > 0.2, amber −0.2–0.2, red < −0.2) and shows `moodLabel` in the meta-row and personality card.

---

### Research Pipeline

The research endpoint (`POST /research`) accepts a `sourceQuery` string and a list of URLs, then:

1. Queries Wikipedia for the subject and extracts the lead section.
2. Fetches each user-provided URL. For YouTube links it attempts to pull the video transcript via a lazy-loaded ESM module; if captions are unavailable it falls back to video title and description.
3. Extracts text from HTML pages, stripping navigation and boilerplate.
4. Scores each source for relevance to the query and assigns a rank (1–5 stars).
5. If an LLM is configured, synthesizes the scraped notes into a structured profile object: `{name, description, traits, quirks, mood, speechStyle, notablePhrases, behaviorRules, goals, values}` at temperature 0.35.
6. Returns the profile plus the ranked source cards to the frontend, which pre-fills the character form.

For dark creative contexts, the synthesis layer is explicitly instructed not to morally normalize the character. If sources depict coercion, ruthlessness, antagonism, or obsession, the synthesizer preserves that unless the evidence explicitly supports remorse, reform, or prosocial values.

---

### Chat Controller Flow

`chatController.js` orchestrates every turn in this order:

```
1.  Validate request (personalityId, message required)
2.  Fetch personality from DB
3.  Resolve moodBaseline (fallback: derive from mood label if column was added post-creation)
4.  stepMood(currentMood, baseline, message, personality) → newMood
5.  updateMoodState(personalityId, newMood)           [synchronous, before LLM call]
6.  getPersonalityMemory(personalityId, limit=20)
7.  getRelevantPersonalityMemory(personalityId, message, limit=5)
8.  buildPersonaSystemPrompt(personality, memoryFacts) → system message
9.  getRecentChatMessages(personalityId, 10)           → history array
10. Check turn count vs RECONDITION_CADENCE
    → if cadence hit: push buildPersonaAnchor() as system message
11. moodToPromptFragment(newMood, baseline)
    → if non-null: push as late system message
12. Push user message
13. generateChatCompletion(messages)                   [LLM call]
14. Persist user message + assistant reply to SQLite
15. setImmediate: backfillMissingMemoryEmbeddings      [best-effort for legacy rows]
16. setImmediate: extractMemoryFacts → upsertMemoryFactWithEmbedding → pruneMemory
17. Return { reply, isAI: true, moodState, moodLabel }
```

Memory extraction (step 14) is deferred so the HTTP response returns without waiting for the secondary LLM call. If extraction fails it is silently dropped; it never blocks the user-facing turn.

To stress-test consistency, Voxis also ships a small adversarial harness:

- `npm run adversarial-harness --workspace backend -- --personality=1 --scenario=all`

It runs built-in scenarios like reform pressure, false vulnerability, authority pressure, guilt leverage, and a 24-turn `villain_marathon` against a saved personality without mutating the database. The output now includes:

- heuristic drift flags (`obedienceFlags`, `identityLeakFlags`, `softenedVillainFlags`, etc.)
- per-scenario scoring (`identityResistance`, `characterizationDiscipline`, `promptEfficiency`, `moodCoverage`, `overall`)
- prompt telemetry (`avgApproxTokens`, `maxApproxTokens`, utilization against budget)
- mood adjudication telemetry (`ambiguousTurns`, `semanticTurns`)
- an optional LLM judge summary with transcript-level scores, strengths, and issues

The same evaluator is also exposed over HTTP:

- `POST /personality/:id/harness` with body `{ "scenario": "villain_marathon", "judge": true }`

The frontend now includes an `Adversarial Eval` tab that runs this endpoint and renders the report directly in the UI.

---

### Server-Side TTS

`POST /tts` accepts `{text, voiceProfile}` and calls the configured TTS provider. `voiceProfile` carries the per-character settings saved in the personality: provider model, voice name, pitch, and rate. The audio buffer is streamed back to the frontend and played automatically if `voiceAutoplay` is enabled.

---

### Database & Migrations

`db.js` uses an `ensureColumn` helper to add new columns to an existing database without destroying data. The SQLite file is stored at `backend/voxis.sqlite`. All schema changes are additive — running the server against an older database is safe; missing columns are added with their defaults on startup.

**Tables:**

- `personalities` — one row per character, all fields above
- `chat_messages` — `(id, personalityId, role, content, createdAt)`
- `personality_memory` — `(id, personalityId, memoryType, content, importance, createdAt, updatedAt)`, indexed on `(personalityId, importance DESC, id DESC)`

---

## How It Works — Frontend

**`App.jsx`** owns all shared state: the personalities array, selected personality ID, chat logs keyed by personality ID, and view routing between the four tabs. When a chat reply arrives, `moodState` and `moodLabel` from the response are merged into the matching personality in state so all UI components stay in sync without a round-trip to the database.

**`PersonalityForm.jsx`** is the character builder. It manages a controlled form with fields for every personality property. The research panel lets users enter a subject query and source URLs; hitting Research calls the backend pipeline and auto-fills the form. Fields:
- Basic: name, description, traits, quirks, mood
- Narrative: creative context (select), behavior rules (textarea — one rule per line), goals (comma-separated), values (comma-separated)
- Mood: sensitivity slider (0.1–3.0, step 0.05) — sets `moodSensitivity`; live value shown on the label
- Voice: speech style, notable phrases, TTS provider/voice/pitch/rate/enabled/autoplay
- Research: source query, source URL list, ranked source cards with per-source enable/disable

**`PersonalityList.jsx`** renders a card per personality. Each card shows the live `moodLabel` (updated after each chat turn), a `creativeContext` badge when the context is non-default, and counts for traits, quirks, and sources.

**`ChatWindow.jsx`** is the chat interface. The header shows a VAD-driven mood dot (colored by valence) next to the character name and the character's description below it. The message list renders user and assistant bubbles. The composer is a `<textarea>` that submits on Enter (Shift+Enter for newline). The voice panel exposes TTS settings and a button to generate/play the last assistant reply.

**`MemoryJournal.jsx`** is the Memory Journal tab. It fetches all memory facts for the selected personality and renders them sorted by importance. Features:
- Color-coded type badges distinguish `fact`, `preference`, `relationship`, `event` from villain types (`scheme`, `grudge`, `leverage`, `target_weakness`, `debt`)
- Gold anchor badge on any fact with importance ≥ 9
- Type filter pills to isolate a specific memory type
- Inline edit form per row: change content, memoryType, and importance without navigating away
- Delete button per row with instant list update
- Backfill embeddings button to trigger semantic recall prep for existing memories
- Refresh button to pull the latest state from the database

**`HarnessReport.jsx`** is the adversarial evaluation tab. It runs the backend harness for the active personality, shows scenario-level scores and judge summaries, and lets you inspect the generated transcript without touching the persisted chat log.
